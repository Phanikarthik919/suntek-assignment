## About the Project

**The Problem Statement:** Modern communities need a platform where content creators (authors) can share their thoughts while administrators ensure the quality of content, and readers can consume and interact with the articles securely.

**The Solution:** This Blog App provides a role-based ecosystem where Authors can create and manage their own articles, Users can read and comment on global articles, and Admins can oversee the platform.

**Live Production URLs:**
- **[ Live Web Application (Frontend)](https://week-5-capstone-project-1.vercel.app/)**
- **[ Hosted API Server (Backend)](https://blog-app-api-peach-gamma.vercel.app)**

## Features List

- **Core Functionality:**
 - Secure User Authentication and Authorization using JWT and Cookies.
 - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
 - **User**: Read articles, filter by category, add comments.
 - **Author**: Create, edit, deactivate/activate, and manage their own articles.
 - **Admin**: Moderate content and manage user/author accounts.
 - Full CRUD operations for articles with categories.
- **Advanced Implementations:**
 - Image uploading and cloud storage via Cloudinary.
 - Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism touches.
 - Custom modals and error boundaries for a premium user experience.
